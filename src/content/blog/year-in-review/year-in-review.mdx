As we reflect on the journey we've taken this year, itâ€™s clear that 2024 has been an incredible one for Diploi.

We kicked off the year with excitement, fresh from pitching Diploi to a group of investors at a Pitch Finland event, hosted by [FiBAN](https://fiban.org/).
Inspired, we were ready to work toward securing our initial pre-seed funding round.

At the time, the MVP version of Diploi was available for anyone to try, allowing us to gather valuable insights from early users.
Some of our first users went above and beyond, providing extensive feedback and ideas. Weâ€™re incredibly grateful to them for their support and enthusiasm, thank you for being amazing!

In May, a standout moment for us was presenting Diploi at a [HelsinkiJS](https://helsinkijs.org/) meeting, held at Finnair's headquarters near Helsinki Airport.
It was great to meet like-minded professionals, discuss how development and test environments can be more effectively managed and what Diploi brings to the table.

As summer approached, we successfully brought together a group of investors and began officially securing our pre-seed funding,
[which was formally announced in September](/blog/diploi-received-pre-seed-funding). This was an important milestone, as it provided the resources we needed to transform Diploi from an MVP into a fully working product.

With funding secured, we got straight into development, while [publishing a roadmap](https://dev.to/diploi/diploi-roadmap-for-2024-1nde) and sharing technical blog posts about our philosophy and methods.

We also made the decision to fully commit to the _config in code_ convention and shared a [preview of our implementation](https://dev.to/diploi/how-we-solved-infrastructure-as-code-2ldn).

In November, we attended [Slush](https://slush.org/) as a startup and had the opportunity to meet with some incredible people! Weâ€™re excited to see you all again next year!

And as the new year approaches, weâ€™re shifting our focus to the future. Our goal is to launch the next version of Diploi for testing early in the year, with a full release to follow later on. So stay tuned!

We want to thank you all for being a part of this exciting year for Diploi, and we look forward to seeing you again next year!

Happy New Year âœ¨ðŸ¥‚
