###### Deploy Supabase in minutes with Diploi, with PostgreSQL preconfigured, and DevOps not required.

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, which offers an instant Postgres database, authentication, storage, and more. With Diploi, you can get Supabase up and running in a fully-managed cloud environment, with no local setup or manual server configuration.

In this post, we’ll walk through getting started with Supabase on Diploi, deploying it to production, and adding a custom domain.

## Getting started with Supabase on Diploi

### What you need

- A GitHub account
- A Diploi account

Signing up in Diploi is free, and does not require credit card.

### How to create a Supabase project

After signing in:

1. Click **Create Project +** in your Dashboard
   ![Create project](../../../images/blog/create-project.png)

2. Under **Pick Components**, select **Supabase**
   ![Selecting the Supabase component](supabase-component.png)

3. Optionally attach any **Add-ons** (like Redis, etc.). PostgreSQL is already included by default
   ![Selecting add-ons](../../../images/blog/selecting-add-ons.png)

4. Under **Repository**, choose **Create Repository** so Diploi scaffolds a GitHub repo for you
   ![Create repository](../../../images/blog/creating-a-repo.png)

5. Click **Launch Stack** to start your environment
   ![Launch project](../../../images/blog/launch-project.png)

This will:

- Scaffold your app with a GitHub repo
- Start a Remote Development environment where you can create custom Supabase Functions
- Launch a live preview URL where you can test Supabase right away
- Allow you to manage ENV variables from the `options` tab

To access the Remote Development environment, you can:

- Use the browser IDE:
  ![Browser IDE](../../../images/blog/browser-ide.png)

- Or connect via SSH using your local editor:
  ![Local IDE](../../../images/blog/using-a-local-ide.png)

When you access the live version of Supabase, you'll be able to manage your Supabase instance.

## Launching your Supabase project to Production

If you are developing a full-stack app or creating custom Supabase Functions, once you are ready to start using your application in production, all you need to do is this:

1. Push changes to GitHub

2. Open your project dashboard in Diploi
   ![Project dashboard](supabase-project-dashboard.png)

3. Click **Create Deployment +** and select **Production** as the stage
   ![Production stage](../../../images/blog/production-stage.png)

4. Choose a **cluster size**
   ![Cluster size selection](../../../images/blog/cluster-size-selection.png)

5. Select the **Git branch** that you'll use for production (e.g. `main`)
   ![Select branch](../../../images/blog/selecting-a-branch.png)

6. Configure any **environment variables** your Supabase app needs
   ![Supabase environment variables](supabase-env-variables.png)

7. Click **Create Deployment**
   ![Create deployment](../../../images/blog/creating-deployment.png)

Diploi builds your production instance and gives you a live URL under the `*.diploi.me` domain. Next, let's assign a custom domain for your Supabase deployment.

## Configuring a custom domain for your Supabase project

To make your Supabase deployment available under your own domain:

1. Go to your Production deployment’s **Options** tab
   ![Deployment options](../../../images/blog/deployment-options.png)

2. Toggle off **Use Auto-Generated Endpoints**

3. Enable **Use Custom Domain** and input your domain (e.g. `db.mydomain.com`)
   ![Add custom domain](../../../images/blog/adding-a-custom-domain.png)

4. Save changes

5. In your domain DNS settings, create a **CNAME** pointing your hostname to `edge.diploi.com`

Diploi handles the SSL certificates automatically. This change usually happens instantly, but sometimes the DNS updates can take up 30 minutes to propagate.

## Trying out Supabase for the first time?

No need to commit to anything. You can test Supabase instantly on Diploi:

- **Trial without signing up**
  Visit [https://diploi.com/#StackBuilder](https://diploi.com/#StackBuilder), select Supabase, and click Launch

- **Quick Launch with your Diploi account**
  Create a new project, and in **Repository**, choose **Quick Launch**
