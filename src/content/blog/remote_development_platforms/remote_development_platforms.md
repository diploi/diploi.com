###### If you code locally, probably you heard this at least once

[Jump to the list of remote development platforms](#top-7-remote-development-platforms-in-2025)

![It works on my machine](works_on_my_machine.png)

Or maybe your version of `node/python/<insert other languages, runtime or framework>` is too old or too new to run the application you are working on, so you need to install an additional tool to manage different versions of said tool

When it is not an issue with the tooling necessary to run your application, it can be a config issue or environment variables missing

Well, there are ways to avoid the additional work required to run an application locally. One example that blew my mind was how the team at OkTurtles handles all of their config, where you don't need any `.env` files or special config for one of their very complex projects, [Group Income](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income), where they put a lot of effort to make the process of onboarding new people and working collaboratively as seamless as possible

Check their video about [how they handle passwords inside Group Income](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaX28k9pJ8s)

BUT... that was a lot of effort and time dedicated to making their product work as consistent as possible for all developers, regardless of the machine you are using

So what about us? I don't want to spend time doing that and chances are you neither...

This leads me to introduce you to:

## Remote Development Environments

Remote development environments are platforms that allow you to code, run, and test your applications in the cloud, eliminating the need for local setup and configuration. This means you can work from anywhere, on any device (even from your mobile browser although with limitations), without worrying about compatibility issues or missing dependencies

The benefits of using remote development platforms include:

- **Consistency**: Ensures that everyone on your team is using the same environment, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem
- **Accessibility**: Access your development environment from any device with an internet connection, making it easier to work on the go
- **Resource Management**: Offload resource-intensive tasks to the cloud, freeing up your local machine
- **Collaboration**: Share your development environment with team members, making it easier to collaborate on projects
- **Scalability**: Easily scale your development environment to handle larger projects or more complex applications
- **Cost-Effective**: Many platforms offer free tiers or pay-as-you-go pricing, making it affordable for individuals and small teams
- **Security**: Remote platforms often provide better security measures than local setups, protecting your code and data
- **Environment Isolation**: Each project can have its isolated environment, preventing conflicts between dependencies
- **Integrated Tools**: Many platforms come with built-in tools for version control, debugging, and deployment, streamlining your workflow

There might be more benefits, but these are the ones I find most relevant for me. When I started working at Diploi, since our product supports remote development, I have been using it for all of my projects, specially for testing and experimenting with new ideas

An example of this is how we use Diploi to develop and test changes to our documentation, where we create a project for our team to host our Docs, and then we can create multiple environments for each team member or feature we are working on

![Diploi remote development environment for our Docs](diploi_shared_project_example.png)

This way I can start coding without running anything locally, and I can share my work with the team by just sharing the link to the project, which is hosted on Diploi

For example, while writing this blog, I created a new remote development environment to show how it works in about 60 seconds:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xu96kVVzgqY?si=aSJHztxYhP_Y6umV" title="How to start a Remote Development Environment and code in the Browser using Diploi" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As you can see, no local setup is required. I simply created a new deployment, and I can start coding right away. But that's not why you are here, you want to know which remote development platforms are available, so let's get to it!

## Top 7 Remote Development Platforms in 2025

---

### DevZero

https://www.devzero.io/cloud-development-environment

> "Ready-to-Code, Cost Efficient Dev Environment."

DevZero is a cloud-based development platform designed to provide developers with ready-to-code, production-like environments. By mirroring production setups, it aims to eliminate the common "it works on my machine" problem, ensuring consistency across development and deployment stages. DevZero leverages MicroVMs to offer isolated environments that dynamically scale resources, optimizing performance and cost

![DevZero dashboard screenshot](devzero.png)

Known as Workspace or DevBoxes in DevZero, these allow developers to create isolated, customizable environments for development, testing, and deployment. These environments are built dynamically from a predefined configuration file called a recipe, which specifies dependencies, tools, and resources.

Each workspace is provisioned with its own Kubernetes cluster and can be launched in a region of the user's choice. This approach ensures consistent environments for team members and supports demanding workloads like CI/CD pipelines and data processing. The next step for users is to create a workspace by selecting or configuring a recipe and launching it on the DevZero platform.

#### IDE options supported

To access and work within DevZero's Workspaces, you can use JetBrains and VS Code with the Remote SSH extension. For either IDE, you will need to install the DevZero's CLI to connect to your workspace

#### Anything free?

DevZero used to offer a free tier, but it seems that they have moved away from this model 🥲

#### Pricing?

DevZero no longer showcases its pricing plans on its website, and the latest information available online comes from SaaSworthy which lists the following plans:

**Starter Plan**: Allows up to 2 users per team and 2 workspaces per user

- **Price**: $0/month

**Pro Plan**: Includes custom roles, up to 15 users, 2 active workspaces per user, and 30 workspaces per team

- **Price**: $39.95 per user per month

**Growth Plan**: Offers storage volumes/buckets, integrations with existing infrastructure, up to 15 teams (max 15 users per team), administrative dashboards, usage controls/policies, and dedicated support SLA

- **Price**: $429.95 per team per month

**Enterprise Plan**: Provides self-hosted options, SSO support, external secret manager, APM, full RBAC, and dedicated support rep with SLA

- **Price**: Custom pricing

https://www.saasworthy.com/product/devzero-io/pricing

But keep in mind that these prices are not directly from DevZero's website and were last updated on the 26th of August 2024, so they are probably not accurate anymore

#### Something else?

You can launch workspaces on DevZero in different regions. The region where a workspace is launched depends on the user's team and subscription tier. Upon signing up, a default region is set, but users can change this preference in their user settings

#### Video demo?

### DevPod

[https://devpod.sh/](https://devpod.sh/)

> Codespaces but... Open Source, Client Only, Unopinionated” 🌱

DevPod is an open‑source tool for creating reproducible development environments using the DevContainer standard. It connects your local IDE to workspaces running locally, in Kubernetes, or on any cloud provider

![DevPod workspace screenshot](devpod.png)

DevPods run based on a `devcontainer.json`, to create consistent environments. You can use DevPod to run your development environments on your own infrastructure. It supports multiple IDEs and provides a CLI and GUI for managing workspaces

#### IDE options supported

DevPod supports VS Code Browser or Desktop, JetBrains IDEs, and connecting any IDE via SSH

#### Anything free?

DevPod is open source and free and uses your own infrastructure to run your workspaces, and only runs on your local machine

#### Pricing?

There seems to be no paid version for DevPod, which I think is because DevPod is part of a larger ecosystem of tools that Loft (creators of DevPod) use to provide tools for Virtualization and Kubernetes management

#### Something else?

DevPod provides a way to create CLI programs called Providers, that enable the creation, management, and running of user-requested workspaces. They support various backends, such as cloud services or container environments. There are two main types:

**Machine providers**, which manage virtual machines (e.g., AWS Provider using EC2)

**Non-Machine providers**, which work directly with containers (e.g., SSH, Kubernetes, or Docker)

Provider configurations are defined in a `provider.yaml` file, and you can learn how to add or develop your own providers through DevPod's documentation
