###### Getting started with Nue.js apps, the easy way

There are plenty of ways to kick off a Nue.js application, cloning a template from a repo, running `nue create simple-blog`, or rolling your own boilerplate from scratch, but today I’m showing you the absolute easiest approach using Diploi.

## How to create an app with Nue.js

1. **Sign up** for a free Diploi account at [https://console.diploi.com/](https://console.diploi.com/)
2. In your Dashboard, click **Create Project +**.
3. Under **Pick Components**, choose **Nue.js**.
   You can also add databases or other frameworks, to your Nue.js stack here.
4. In **Pick Add‑ons**, select any services your app needs (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, or MongoDB).
5. Choose **Create Repository** to start from a fresh GitHub repo.
6. Click **Launch Stack**.

Diploi will provision a full development environment for your Nue.js app. You’ll be able to:

* Preview your app live in the browser.
* Edit code directly via the Browser IDE.
* Connect over SSH for remote development with VS Code, WebStorm, or any IDE that supports SSH and dev containers.

## Launching your Nue.js app to Production

When your app is ready for real‑world traffic, follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to your Nue.js Project’s dashboard at
   `https://console.diploi.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`
2. Click **Create Deployment +**.
3. Select **Production** as the stage.
4. Pick the **cluster size** that matches your expected load.
5. Choose the **source branch** (e.g., `main`).
6. Configure any **environment variables** your app requires.
7. Hit **Create Deployment +**.

Your Nue.js application will be live, and ready to serve users!

## Configuring a custom domain for your Nue.js application in Production

By default, your production deployment uses a `.diploi.app` domain. To swap in your own:

1. On your Production Deployment’s **Options** tab (or via
   `https://console.diploi.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/deployment/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID>/options`), find **Endpoints**.
2. Click **Use Auto‑Generated Endpoints** to disable it.
3. An input field will appear showing your `.diploi.app` URL plus a checkbox for **Custom Domain**. Enable that checkbox and enter your domain.
4. Scroll down and click **Save Changes**.
5. In your DNS provider’s dashboard, create a **CNAME** record pointing your domain to **edge.diploi.com**.

It can take up to 30 minutes for DNS propagation and SSL certificate to be ready.

## Trying out Nue.js for the first time?

Diploi lets you test Nue.js without installing anything locally. Two ways to spin up a sandbox:

* **Not yet on Diploi?**
  Launch a free trial from the Diploi Stack Builder:
  [https://diploi.com/#StackBuilder](https://diploi.com/#StackBuilder)
  or go straight to the Nue.js component page:
  [https://diploi.com/component/nue](https://diploi.com/component/nue)

* **Already a Diploi user?**
  Create a new project, then under **Repository** select **Quick Launch**, you’ll get a throwaway environment preconfigured with Nue.js and any add‑ons you choose, no Git repo required.
