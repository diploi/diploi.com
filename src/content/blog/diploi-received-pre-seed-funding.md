Diploi, a SaaS service for managing, developing and hosting software applications, has completed its first pre-seed funding round. Founded in 2024 by the team of _Marcus Ahlfors_, _Patrik Lindberg_, _Tuomas Pöyry_ and _Ville-Pekka Lahti_ with the ultimate goal of taking away the pain of software development by letting developers focus on their main task - to develop new and better software. The team built a pilot of the cloud-based service in spring of 2024, taking on trial users and first customers.

Discussions with business angels through the Finnish Business Angel Network, FIBAN, began, resulting in 8 business angels together with the Angel CoFund investment fund participating in the completion of a pre-seed funding round of 250,000 euros. This will enable the team to further develop the Diploi service and platform to cover more technology tools, streamline product offering and develop a go-to-market strategy for the upcoming years.

Diploi aims to offer a uniform SaaS solution supporting the life span of the user’s application from development to production. The solution integrates main developer tools and processes into one coherent space, enabling developers and testers to fully focus on high quality development, minimizing setup and management needs. The Diploi team members have long-time experience in delivering software solutions and services to both B2B and B2C customers, covering everything from startups and SMBs to publicly traded companies.
