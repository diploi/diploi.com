###### Launching a Ghost blog using Diploi to customize and host it

If you are into self-hosting open-source services, this guide will be useful for you. Diploi gets you from zero to a live blog in seconds, and the best part is that you can also customize your Ghost blogs at code level, without the need to run anything locally using Diploi's remote development capabilities. Let's get straight to it!

   `https://console.diploi.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/deployment/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID>/options`
2. In **Endpoints**, disable **Use Auto-Generated Endpoints**
3. Youâ€™ll see your current subdomain and a **Use custom domain** checkbox
4. Enable it and enter your domain (e.g. `example.com`)
5. Scroll down and **Save Changes**
6. In your DNS provider, create a **CNAME** record pointing your domain to **edge.diploi.com**

Allow up to ~30 minutes for DNS and SSL to propagate.
