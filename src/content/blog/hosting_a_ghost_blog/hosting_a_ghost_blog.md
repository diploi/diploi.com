###### Launching a Ghost blog using Diploi to customize and host it

If you're interested in self-hosting open-source services, this guide will be useful for you. Diploi gets you from zero to a live blog in seconds, and the best part is that you can also customize your Ghost blogs at the code level, without the need to run anything locally using Diploi's remote development capabilities. Let's get straight to it!

## Creating a blog with Ghost

1. **Sign up** for Diploi at `https://console.diploi.com/` using your GitHub account.
2. In your dashboard, click **Create Project +**
3. Under **Pick Components**, choose **Ghost**  
 If you want to expand your Ghost blog with other tools, like a backend framework to add an API, in this section, you can add them. They will all be hosted on a single server, reducing costs and complexity.
4. In **Pick Add-ons**, select any databases or tools you want to include.
5. In **Repository**, choose **Create Repository** which will generate a new GitHub repo for you.
6. Click **Launch Stack**

Diploi provisions a full cloud dev environment where you can:

- Preview your Ghost site instantly
- Work in the browser IDE, **or** connect over SSH with your favorite editor (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)

## Ship your Ghost blog to Production

Once you are ready to create and launch your blog to production, you can create a new deployment, ready to receive your users:

1. Open your projectâ€™s dashboard:  
   `https://console.diploi.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`
2. Click **Create Deployment +**
3. Choose **Production** as the stage
4. Pick a **cluster size** that fits your needs
5. Select the **source branch** to deploy (eg. `main`)
6. Add any necessary **environment variables**
7. Click **Create Deployment +**

Thatâ€™s it, your Ghost blog is deployed and ready to scale. To access the admin panel, you must add to your Ghost URL the slug `/ghost`, where you can setup your password and then access your site's dashboard.

Example:
`example.com/ghost`

## Set up a custom domain for your Ghost site

By default, youâ€™ll get a `.diploi.me` URL. To use your own domain:

1. Go to your Production deploymentâ€™s **Options** tab:  
   `https://console.diploi.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/deployment/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID>/options`
2. In **Endpoints**, disable **Use Auto-Generated Endpoints**
3. Youâ€™ll see your current subdomain and a **Use custom domain** checkbox
4. Enable it and enter your domain (eg. `example.com`)
5. Scroll down and **Save Changes**
6. In your DNS provider, create a **CNAME** record pointing your domain to **edge.diploi.com**

Allow up to ~30 minutes for DNS and SSL to propagate.

## New to Ghost? Try it in the cloud first for free

You donâ€™t need a local setup to explore Ghost on Diploi:

- **No account yet?**  
 Use the **Stack Builder** to spin up a temporary environment and test the workflow [https://diploi.com/#StackBuilder](https://diploi.com/#StackBuilder) without registering for an account and for free.

- **Already signed in?**  
 Create a new project and select **Quick Launch** in the **Repository** section to start experimenting without wiring up a new repository.
